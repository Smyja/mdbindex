Why MindsDB? Well, as with most names, we needed one. We like science fiction and The Culture The Culture series,\nwhere the AI super-smart entities are called Minds Minds . So that\u2019s for the first\npart of our name. As for the second part - the DB DB , it is quite self-explanatory. Although we\nwill support all kinds of data in the future, but currently, our objective is to\nadd intelligence to existing data stores and databases. Hence, the term DB DB comes along. So there we have it, MindsDB. So there we have it, MindsDB. And why the bear? We wanted to honor the open-source tradition of animals\nrelated to projects. We went for a bear because MindsDB was born at UC Berkeley,\nwhere the first codes were written. Then, we went a step further and decided for\na polar bear. And why the bear?

Use the CREATE MODEL (Reference url: https://docs.mindsdb.com/quickstart/sql/create/predictor) CREATE MODEL CREATE MODEL statement, as below. ```\nCREATE MODEL mindsdb.home_rentals_model\nFROM example_data\n  (SELECT * FROM demo_data.home_rentals)\nPREDICT rental_price;\n\n```CREATE CREATE MODEL mindsdb . . home_rentals_model FROM FROM example_data ( ( SELECT SELECT * * FROM FROM demo_data . . home_rentals ) ) PREDICT rental_price ; ; On execution, we get: On execution, we get: ```\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (9.79 sec)\n\n```Query OK , , 0 0 rows rows affected ( ( 9.79 9.79 sec ) ) \u200b (Reference url: https://docs.mindsdb.com/quickstart#6-check-the-status-of-a-model) \u200b 6. Check the Status of a Model 6. Check the Status of a Model It may take a couple of minutes until the model is trained. You can monitor\nthe status of your model by executing the following command: It may take a couple of minutes until the model is trained. You can monitor\nthe status of your model by executing the following command: ```\nSELECT status\nFROM mindsdb.models\nWHERE name = 'home_rentals_model';\n\n```SELECT SELECT status status FROM FROM mindsdb . . models WHERE WHERE name = = 'home_rentals_model' 'home_rentals_model' ; ; On execution, we get: On execution, we get: ```\n+------------+\n| status     |\n+------------+\n| generating |\n+------------+\n\n```+ + ------------+ ------------+ | | status status | | + + ------------+ ------------+ | | generating | | + + ------------+ ------------+ After a short time, we get: After a short time, we get: ```\n+----------+\n| status   |\n+----------+\n| training |\n+----------+\n\n```+ + ----------+ ----------+ | | status status | | + + ----------+ ----------+ | | training | | + + ----------+ ----------+ And finally, we get: And finally, we get: ```\n+----------+\n| status   |\n+----------+\n| complete |\n+----------+\n\n```+ + ----------+ ----------+ | | status status | | + + ----------+ ----------+ | | complete | | + + ----------+ ----------+ Alternatively, you can use the SHOW MODELS SHOW MODELS command as below. ```\nSHOW MODELS\n[FROM project_name]\n[LIKE 'model_name']\n[WHERE column_name = value];\n\n```SHOW SHOW MODELS [ [ FROM FROM project_name ] ] [ [ LIKE LIKE 'model_name' 'model_name' ] ] [ [ WHERE WHERE column_name = = value value ] ] ; ; Here is an example: Here is an example: ```\nSHOW MODELS\nFROM mindsdb\nLIKE 'home_rentals_model'\nWHERE status = 'complete';\n\n```SHOW SHOW MODELS FROM FROM mindsdb LIKE LIKE 'home_rentals_model' 'home_rentals_model' WHERE WHERE status status = = 'complete' 'complete' ; ; The status of the model must be complete complete before you can start making predictions. \u200b (Reference url: https://docs.mindsdb.com/quickstart#7-make-predictions-using-select) \u200b 7. Make Predictions Using SELECT (Reference url: https://docs.mindsdb.com/quickstart/sql/api/select) SELECT SELECT The SELECT (Reference url: https://docs.mindsdb.com/quickstart/sql/api/select) SELECT SELECT statement allows you to make predictions based\non features, where features are the input variables, or input columns, that are\nused to make forecasts. Let\u2019s predict what would be the rental price of a 1000 square feet house with\ntwo bathrooms. Let\u2019s predict what would be the rental price of a 1000 square feet house with\ntwo bathrooms. ```\nSELECT rental_price\nFROM mindsdb.home_rentals_model\nWHERE number_of_bathrooms = 2\nAND sqft = 1000;\n\n```SELECT SELECT rental_price FROM FROM mindsdb . . home_rentals_model WHERE WHERE number_of_bathrooms = = 2 2 AND AND sqft = = 1000 1000 ; ; On execution, we get: On execution, we get: ```\n+--------------+\n| rental_price |\n+--------------+\n| 1130         |\n+--------------+\n\n```+ + --------------+ --------------+ | | rental_price | | + + --------------+ --------------+ | | 1130 1130 | | + + --------------+ --------------+ Here is how to make batch predictions: Here is how to make batch predictions: ```\nSELECT m.rental_price, m.rental_price_explain\nFROM mindsdb.home_rentals_model AS m\nJOIN example_data.demo_data.home_rentals AS d;\n\n```SELECT SELECT m . . rental_price , , m . . rental_price_explain FROM FROM mindsdb . . home_rentals_model AS AS m JOIN JOIN example_data . . demo_data . . home_rentals AS AS d ; ; Congratulations!
